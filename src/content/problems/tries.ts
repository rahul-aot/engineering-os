Design a data structure that stores a set of words and can quickly answer
two kinds of questions about them: "is this *exact* word in the set?" and
"does *any* word in the set start with this prefix?"

Build a class with three operations:

- \`insert(word)\` - adds a word to the structure.
- \`search(word)\` - returns true only if that exact word was previously inserted.
- \`startsWith(prefix)\` - returns true if any inserted word begins with that prefix (the prefix itself doesn't need to have been inserted as a whole word).

        explanation: '"apple" is inserted, so search("apple") is true. search("app") is false because "app" was never inserted on its own - but startsWith("app") is true because "apple" starts with "app". After inserting "app" directly, search("app") becomes true too.',
      },

        input: 'insert("cat"); search("car"); startsWith("ca")',
        output: "undefined, false, true",

    ],
    approachOverview: `
The key insight is that many words share prefixes ("app" and "apple" both
start with "a" -> "p" -> "p"). A **trie** (prefix tree) exploits this by
giving each *letter position* its own node, shared across every word that
agrees up to that point. Starting at a root node, each node holds links
to its possible next letters (its children) plus a boolean flag for
"a word ends here."

\`insert\` walks the word letter by letter, creating child nodes as needed,
and marks the final node as a word-ending. \`search\` walks the same way but
fails if any letter is missing, and requires the final node's flag to be
set. \`startsWith\` is identical to \`search\` except it doesn't check that
flag - just that the path exists.

node has children keyed by letter and a flag for word-endings. The only
change is in how \`search\` walks the tree: a regular letter still follows
exactly one child, but a \`.\` means "try every child this node has" and
succeed if *any* of them leads to a full match on the rest of the query.

That "try every possibility, succeed if one works" is a small
backtracking search layered on top of the trie structure, so \`search\`
becomes a recursive helper that takes the current trie node and how far
into the query string it's gotten.

Searching the grid separately for each word (brute force) means redoing a
lot of the same exploration, since many words share prefixes. Instead,
build a single **trie** out of the entire word list first.

Then do one DFS from every cell in the grid. At each step, only continue
into a neighboring cell if the current trie node has a child for that
cell's letter - the trie prunes the search the moment the letters-so-far
stop being a prefix of *any* word. Whenever the trie node reached is
marked as a complete word, that word has been found. Cells already used
in the current path are temporarily marked so they aren't reused, then
unmarked ("backtracked") once that branch of exploration is done.

A couple of practical optimizations keep this fast: once a word is found,
remove it from consideration in the trie so it isn't rediscovered
repeatedly, and prune trie nodes that have no children left.
